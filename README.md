A simple, easy to use, e621 API interface for Python!

## Todos

- Treat the Public API as an object, make it initialize once and be reutilized many times, mostly to prevent unnecessary repetition and to maybe make some useful stuff with the returned objects.
- Make a way to be able to query multiple posts with a single request, as otherwise it's really slow.
- Expand the Public API with all of the features which do not require login/authentication.
- Add the Private API, which are the parts of the API that require login/authentication.
- Merge the Public with the Private API so it becomes simpler to use, treating authentication as an optional argument to initialize.
- Write a wiki and documentation for the project.
- Write more examples for newcomers to get a better picture of how to use the API.
